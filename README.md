Outlay - Expense Tracker
====================
[![Outlay on Google Play Store](http://style.anu.edu.au/_anu/images/icons/icon-google-play-small.png)](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=app.outlay)

Recently I have realized that I need to track my expenses. Unfortunately I could not find existing application that would fit me perfectly: too many configurations, options, buttonsâ€¦ So I decided to create my own app and share it with you. 

Outlay makes tracking your expenses so easy and simple. Fewest taps are necessary to create an expense. Customize your categories with colors, icons, order. Reports with charts give overview of exactly where your money is going each day, week or month.

 - clean user experience and simple interface
 - custom categories with color, icon
 - exhaustive reports per day, week, month

App covers all of my current needs, but there are a lot of possible improvements, so feel free to request features and share your feedback.

Also project shows simplified clean architecture of android app with usage:
------------

- Dagger 2
- RxJava
- ItemTouchHelper (for dragging items withing grid view)
- MVP
- Material Design tools
- Iconic font usage
- Firebase
